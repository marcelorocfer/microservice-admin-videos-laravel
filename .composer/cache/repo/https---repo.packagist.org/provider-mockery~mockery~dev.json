Its core goal is to offer a test double framework with a succinct API capable of clearly defining all possible object operations and interactions using a human readable Domain Specific Language (DSL). Designed as a drop in alternative to PHPUnit's phpunit-mock-objects library, Mockery is easy to integrate with PHPUnit and can operate alongside phpunit-mock-objects without the World ending.","homepage":"http://github.com/padraic/mockery","version":"0.9.x-dev","version_normalized":"0.9.9999999.9999999-dev","source":{"url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","type":"git","reference":"f356e061d8ae815cd283fdc8f4412b635044be3c"},"dist":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/f356e061d8ae815cd283fdc8f4412b635044be3c","type":"zip","shasum":"","reference":"f356e061d8ae815cd283fdc8f4412b635044be3c"},"time":"2019-05-13T15:59:04+00:00","extra":{"branch-alias":{"dev-master":"0.9.x-dev"}},"require":{"php":">=5.3.2","lib-pcre":">=7.0","hamcrest/hamcrest-php":"~1.1"},"require-dev":{"phpunit/phpunit":"~4.0"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/0.9"}},{"description":"Mockery is a simple yet flexible PHP mock object framework","homepage":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery","version":"dev-chore/refactor-all-the-things","version_normalized":"dev-chore/refactor-all-the-things","source":{"url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","type":"git","reference":"b7e9a87db7810743f48079933d430ef76abc6641"},"dist":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/b7e9a87db7810743f48079933d430ef76abc6641","type":"zip","shasum":"","reference":"b7e9a87db7810743f48079933d430ef76abc6641"},"time":"2023-04-19T16:52:04+00:00","autoload":{"files":["library/helpers.php","library/Mockery.php"],"psr-4":{"Mockery\\":"library/Mockery"}},"extra":{"branch-alias":{"dev-master":"1.4.x-dev"}},"require":{"php":"^7.3 || ^8.0","lib-pcre":">=7.0","hamcrest/hamcrest-php":"^2.0.1"},"require-dev":{"phpunit/phpunit":"^8.5 || ^9.3","psalm/plugin-phpunit":"^0.18","vimeo/psalm":"^5.9"},"conflict":{"phpunit/phpunit":"<8.0"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/chore/refactor-all-the-things"}},{"version":"dev-feature/refactor-internal-classes","version_normalized":"dev-feature/refactor-internal-classes","source":{"url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","type":"git","reference":"6283364874ca9001b99069ffa869d009ed31ccd4"},"dist":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/6283364874ca9001b99069ffa869d009ed31ccd4","type":"zip","shasum":"","reference":"6283364874ca9001b99069ffa869d009ed31ccd4"},"time":"2023-04-15T03:06:10+00:00","support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/feature/refactor-internal-classes"}},{"version":"dev-mock-internals","version_normalized":"dev-mock-internals","source":{"url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","type":"git","reference":"aa3b17f3d38e8d9c08da83438e2f1e3a94949922"},"dist":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/aa3b17f3d38e8d9c08da83438e2f1e3a94949922","type":"zip","shasum":"","reference":"aa3b17f3d38e8d9c08da83438e2f1e3a94949922"},"time":"2023-02-22T11:37:44+00:00","autoload":{"psr-0":{"Mockery":"library/"}},"require-dev":{"phpunit/phpunit":"^8.5 || ^9.3"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/mock-internals"}},{"version":"dev-remove-comments-from-mock-pass","version_normalized":"dev-remove-comments-from-mock-pass","source":{"url":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery.git","type":"git","reference":"939187a6c3a6df87380e83c4ffaca02e4a07b75b"},"dist":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mockery/mockery/zipball/939187a6c3a6df87380e83c4ffaca02e4a07b75b","type":"zip","shasum":"","reference":"939187a6c3a6df87380e83c4ffaca02e4a07b75b"},"time":"2019-12-04T08:38:00+00:00","extra":{"branch-alias":{"dev-master":"1.3.x-dev"}},"require":{"php":">=5.6.0","lib-pcre":">=7.0","hamcrest/hamcrest-php":"~2.0","sebastian/comparator":"^1.2.4|^3.0"},"require-dev":{"phpunit/phpunit":"~5.7.10|~6.5|~7.0|~8.0"},"support":{"issues":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/issues","source":"https://github.com/mockery/mockery/tree/remove-comments-from-mock-pass"},"conflict":"__unset"}]},"last-modified":"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 18:21:01 GMT"}
